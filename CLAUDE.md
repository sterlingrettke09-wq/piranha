# Piranha — project notes for Claude

Parcel-level building-feasibility tool (thepiranhaproject.com). Vite + React 19
+ TypeScript + Tailwind v4, Netlify Functions + one Edge Function. See
README.md for env vars and deploy.

## Architecture in one minute

- `src/` — SPA. Routes lazy-load from `src/App.tsx`. City config lives in
  `src/config/cities.ts` (single source of truth for slugs/labels/centers);
  cost/timeline constants in `src/config/estimates.ts` — the Methodology page
  derives its tables from these, so changing them changes the published math.
- `netlify/functions/` — `/api/parcel` and `/api/analyze` are deterministic
  (city ArcGIS services + Mapbox reverse geocode; NO LLM). `/api/ask` calls
  Google Gemini. `log-search`/`searches-log` are the private search log
  (Netlify Blobs). Shared abuse guards in `netlify/functions/lib/guard.ts`.
- `netlify/edge-functions/og.ts` rewrites <title>/meta/canonical per route —
  it string-matches the tags in `index.html`; keep the two in sync.
- Per-city parcel data adapters: `netlify/functions/lib/providers/*.ts`.

## Conventions

- Tests are Vitest, colocated as `*.test.ts`. Run `npm test`; lint with
  `npm run lint`; typecheck via `npm run build` (tsc -b first).
- Business-logic heuristics (`src/lib/developability.ts`, `siteFlags.ts`) are
  deliberately conservative — never broaden a block-regex without a test
  showing it can't catch a legitimate private parcel.
- No secrets in the client except `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` (public by design,
  URL-restricted in the Mapbox dashboard). Anything else stays in
  `process.env` inside functions.
- The CSP in `netlify.toml` is strict: adding a new third-party script, style,
  or fetch target requires extending it.
